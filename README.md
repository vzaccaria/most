**MOST** (Multi-Objective System Optimizer) is a tool for architectural design
space exploration. **MOST** is an interactive program that lets the designer
explore a design space of configurations for a particular architecture for which
an executable model (or _driver_) exists. **MOST** can be extended by
introducing new optimization algorithms such as Monte Carlo optimization,
sensitivity based optimization and, as an example, Taguchi design of
experiments. All of this by using an appropriate API.

# Installation

At the moment the best way to install and run MOST is through a docker container
with the available MOST development and test Docker image:

```shell
docker run -ti -v ${PWD}:/local vzaccaria/most:latest

# in the container (root@....)
mkdir build
cd build
source ../bootstrap.sh
make
make install

# To test
# make test

# now you will find the tool installed in /opt/bin
/opt/bin/most

MOST is currently updated and maintained by Vittorio Zaccaria. Other
contributors are Gianluca Palermo, Fabrizio Castro, Giovanni Mariani, Vailati
Mattia, and Franzini Paolo.

MOST is derived from two projects: the System Tuning Shell and Multicube
Explorer. The System Tuning Shell was originally designed and coded internally
at Politecnico di Milano by Vittorio Zaccaria while Lorenzo Salvemini, Simone
Valsecchi and Gianluca Palermo contributed to various aspects of the
implementation and testing. The prefix `st_` in front of source code files is an
heritage coming from the System Tuning Shell.

Multicube Explorer was a tool developed for the Multicube project (MULTICUBE
FP7-216693) by Politecnico di Milano and Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana. Its
authors were Vittorio Zaccaria, Gianluca Palermo, Giovanni Mariani, Fabrizio
Castro.
