# Linear Response Surface Model 
## OVERVIEW
 Creates a linear regression-based prediction model for the entire design space. Linear regression is a method that models a linear relationship between a dependent response function and some independent variables. In the general class of regression models, the response is modeled as a weighted sum of independent variables plus random noise. Since the basic linear estimates may not adequately capture nuances in the response-independent variable relationship, the implemented plugin takes into account also the interactions between the independent variables (the design parameters) as well as quadratic behaviour with respect to a single parameter.

# Neural Network Model (predictions made only on DoE) 
## OVERVIEW
 Computes an artificial neural network model. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a mathematical model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks. It consists of an interconnected group of artificial neurons. An artificial neuron is a mathematical function that models a biological neuron. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (synapse). Usually the sums of each node are weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network during the learning phase. The learning method implemented is based on the Cascade 2 architecture: S.E.Fahlman, D.Baker, J.Boyan, The Cascade2 learning architecture, Technical Report, CMU-CS-TR-96-184, Carnegie Mellon University, 1996.

# Radial Basis Functions Model (predictions made only on DoE) 
## OVERVIEW
 Computes the RBF model for design points specified with a design of experiment module. Radial Basis Functions (RBF) represent a widely used interpolation/approximation model, whose values depends only on the distance from the origin or alternatively on the distance from some other point called center. Any radial function is suitable as distance function. Interesting radial functions definitions are: linear, thin plate spline, multiquadric, inverse multiquadric and gaussian. The approximating function is represented as a sum of radial basis functions, each associated with a center and weighted by an appropriate coefficient. The implemented approach is based on: M.J.D. Powell. The theory of radial basis functions approximation in 1990, W.A. Light (Ed.), Advances in Numerical Analysis II: Wavelets, Subdivision, Algorithms, and Radial Basis Functions, Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 105-210, 1992.

# SPLINE response surface model (predictions made only on DoE) 
## OVERVIEW
 Computes a SPLINE prediction for the design points specified in the Design of Experiments. Interpolation is the process of assigning values to unknown points by using a small set of known points and does not produce any error on the known data. Spline is a form of interpolation where the interpolant function is divided into intervals defining multiple different continuous polynomials with endpoints called knots.
